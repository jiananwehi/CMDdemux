Description: CMDdemux is a package for demultiplexing single-cell hashing data. 
     When cells are pooled together, CMDdemux classifies the sample origin of each 
     single cell using its hashing label. The method is based on within-CLR 
     normalization, k-medoids clustering, and Mahalanobis distance.
