# CMDdemux
CMDdemux is a single-cell demultiplexing tool that identifies each cell from hashtag oligonucleotide (HTO) data. It accurately distinguishes singlets, doublets, and negatives in high-quality data, and remains effective with low-quality data, including weak or strong signals, contamination, empty droplets, and low-input cell hashing data.

## Installation
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jiananwehi/CMDdemux")
library(CMDdemux)
```
